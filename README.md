- 👋 Hi, I’m Frans de Haan
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end and back-end development, but I want to make my own 8-bit computer one day too. So that I can understand how a computer works on a deeper level.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css, JavaScript and Node.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects that can help me to improve my coding skills
- 📫 You can reach me through my email "f.pdehaan1992@gmail.com"
